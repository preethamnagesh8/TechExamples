Hello Everyone.

The Owasp Top 10 API 2019 project is intended to learn and understand the OWASP top 10 API vulnerabilities with hands on examples.
Here you will find examples that are vulnerable and how it can be fixed.

I am a beginner in Cyber Security and am interested in secure code practices and implementation in coding.
Along with me myself learning these concept, I would also like to explain them to all those Cyber Security Secure Code Enthusiasts.

As goes the saying teaching a concept helps the teacher understand the concept better.

Please feel free to provide suggestions and any improvements needed.
